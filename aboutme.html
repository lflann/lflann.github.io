<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I was born on July 10, 2000 in Portland, Maine. I grew up in Cape Elizabeth and went to school there until I graduated in 2018.</p> 
<p>I like to consider myself an active person and am happiest in the outdoors. My favorite season is winter because I love skiing.</p>
<p>In the future I hope to open my own business either in the ski industry or in the medical marijuana industry.</p>
